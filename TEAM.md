Right now we think that we will be switching roles often,\
so noone has any specific roles at the moment.

We have a main and develop branch.\
In the future we will mostly build feature branches and merge them into develop branch.\
And only stable versions will be merged into main branch.

We used rebase and squash merge strategies.

We chose rebase when we wanted to keep the commit history in main when there were multiple commits to merge\
And we chose squash when there was only 1 commit when doing a merge,\
because if there is only 1 commit then there wont be anything to squash and we wont lose commits.

We didn't really encounter any issues with the merge strategies.
